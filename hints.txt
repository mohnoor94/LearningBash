1- echo $PATH  =>   prints all paths that your system will look for any script you excecute
                    if you save your scripts to any of these paths, you can run your script
                    from anywhere in your system.
                    This way; no need for (./) before the name of the script.
                    Common paths to save your scripts are:  /usr/local/bin  (all users scripts)
                                                            /usr/local/sbin (system admin scripts)


2- create a file '~/.bash_profile'  =>  Add any thing to your $PATH there, and every time
                                        you logged in to your system; this will be executed
                                        and be available for you.
                                        Example of '~/.bash_profile' contents could be:
                                        PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
                                        export PATH
                                        * Note: you have to logout then login again for the
                                        changes to be available.
